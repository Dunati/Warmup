Warmup
======

Measures addon loading times.

The report frame automatically opens on a fresh login if not in combat. Type `/warmup` to open the frame again later. Scroll with the mousewheel. Hold Shift to scroll to the top or bottom. Hold Ctrl to scroll a full page up or down.

**Note:** Memory measurements are probably not accurate at the moment, especially garbage collection numbers. I may or may not look into the memory debugging API later. Pull requests welcome!
